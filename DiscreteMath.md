##### The Sum Principle
The number of elements among a finite number of disjoint finite sets A, B, ..., N is the sume of their size. $|A| + |B| + \cdots + |N|$

######Example: An employer offers 10 days of pto, 3 paid sick days and 4 paid personal days per year. How many days can one not work and still get paid?
$10 + 3 + 4 = 17$

##### Cartesian product
Cartesian product of tow sets A and B, denoted $A\times B$ is a set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.
$A \times B = \{(a,b) \mid a \in A \wedge b \in B\}$

Ordered n-tuples $(a,b,\ldots,n)$ are members of the set denoted $A \times B \times \cdots \times N$, Called the Catesian product of the sets $A, B, \ldots, N $
